 ## Tokens and the Value Tangle
 The Pollen release of the Goshimmer node implements the _Value Tangle_, 
 a distributed ledger of tokens. We won't go into the detail of the Value Tangle. The introduction 
 of it can be found [here](../intro/utxo.md). We only have to know that Value Tangle contains
 balances of colored tokens locked in addresses, like this: 
 ```
Address: Yk85765qdrwheQ4udj6RihxtPxudTSWF9qYe4NsAfp6K
    IOTA: 1000
    Red: 15
    Green: 200
```
where `IOTA` is the color code of IOTA tokens and `Red` and `Green` are other color codes (color codes are 32-byte hashes). 
Tokens can only be moved on the _Value Tangle_ by the private key of the corresponding address. 
(In this tutorial we will use `private key`, `signature scheme` and `wallet` as synonyms).  

The `Solo` environment implements in-memory Value Tangle ledger to the finest details. 
For example, one can only move tokens by creating and submitting valid and signed transactions in Solo. 
One can also create new wallets on the Value Tangle, request iotas from the faucet.

The following code shows how to do it:
```go
func TestSolo2(t *testing.T) {
	env := solo.New(t, false, false)
	userWallet := env.NewSignatureSchemeWithFunds()   // create new wallet and request funds from genesis
	userAddress := userWallet.Address()
	t.Logf("Address of the userWallet is: %s", userAddress)
	numIotas := env.GetAddressBalance(userAddress, balance.ColorIOTA)  // how many iotas contains the address
	t.Logf("balance of the userWallet is: %d iota", numIotas)
	env.AssertAddressBalance(userAddress, balance.ColorIOTA, 1337) // assert the address has 1337 iotas
}
```
 The output of the test:
```
=== RUN   TestSolo2
    solo_test.go:29: Address of the userWallet is: WUwewZS3JFtEUtsfR5HcUANzyADv8pSmK7j6SuayNDRv
    solo_test.go:31: balance of the userWallet is: 1337 iota
--- PASS: TestSolo2 (0.00s)
```
 
The token ledger of the Value Tangle is shared among all chains deployed on the global environment `env`
of the test. It serves as a medium for transactions between smart contracts on different chains. 
It makes it possible to test transacting between chains on _Solo_.
 
Note that in the test above we didnâ€™t deploy any chains: the Value Tangle exists in the `env` variable, 
outside of any chains.
