## Calling a view from the Solo environment
The statement in the above example call a view entry point `getCounter` of the smart contract `example1`:
```
res, err := chain.CallView("example1", "getString")
```
The call returns a result res, a collection of key/value pairs and error (if not nil).

The basic principle of calling a view is similar to sending a request to the smart contract. 
The essential difference is that calling a view is not a transaction but just a synchronous call 
to the view entry point function, exposed by the smart contract.

Naturally, calling a view doesnâ€™t involve any token transfer. 
Sending a request to a view entry point will result in an exception. It will return of all attached 
tokens back to the sender (minus fees).

Views are used to retrieve information about the state of the smart contract, 
for example to display it on a website. In the Solo environment, certain methods such as `chain.GetInfo`, 
`chain.GetFeeInfo` and `chain.GetTotalAssets` call views of the core smart contracts behind scenes 
to retrieve the information about the chain or specific smart contract.
