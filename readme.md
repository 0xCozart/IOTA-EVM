# Wasp: a node for IOTA Smart Contracts


The _IOTA Smart Contract Protocol_ (ISCP in short) is a protocol on top of the core Value Tangle
protocol run by GoShimmer nodes. 

_Wasp_ node implements ISCP. To run smart contract you will need a network of _Wasp_ nodes.
Each _Wasp_ connects to _Goshimmer_ node to have access to the Value Tangle, 
the layer which implements the ledger of tokens.   

The repository represents code which can only be used in testing configurations, 
it is not ready for the commercial use.

For detailed instruction how to run a Wasp node please use [this wiki article](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp/wiki).

Wiki also contains introduction to the concepts of _IOTA Smart Contracts_.
