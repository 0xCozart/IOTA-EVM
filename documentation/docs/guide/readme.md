# ISCP Documentation

Goal of the documentation: Give a higher level overview of what ISCP is and how it works for the average developer building applications for ISCP or looking to run a chain/node. Doesnâ€™t need to contain every explicit detail but should contain everything you need to know to set up a smart contract chain and run and interact with smart contracts.

## ISCP Core concepts

- [What are smart contracts?](/docs/guide/core_concepts/smart-contracts)
- [What is ISCP?](/docs/guide/core_concepts/iscp)
- [ISCP Architecture overview](/docs/guide/core_concepts/iscp-architecture)
- Committees and validators, consensus
- State, transitions and state anchoring
- Accounts
    - How accounts work
    - How to deposit to a chain
    - How to withdraw from a chain
- Interacting with smart contracts
    - On-ledger requests
    - Off-ledger requests
- Types of VMs/Languages
    - How ISCP works as a language/VM agnostic platform
    - Rust/Wasm based smart contracts
        - Why and what does it look like?
        - Pros and cons
    - Solidity/EVM based smart contracts
        - Why and what does it look like?
        - Pros and cons
