# ISCP Architecture 

With ISCP anyone can start a own chain and define the validators. Each chain has its own state 
where a state update (going from one block to the next) is hashed and published to the main tangle
as well by moving a special state anchor on Layer 1. This makes ISCP a more complex implementation
of smart contracts over say Ethereum as illustrated here:
