# Off-ledger Requests

The alternative way of sending requests is so-called `off-ledger` requests. Its an API call to the Wasp node, which has access
to the state of the target chain, an `access node`. The `off-ledger` request is not a transaction so
no need to confirm it on the Tangle. The `off-ledger` requests are much faster.
