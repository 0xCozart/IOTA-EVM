# On-ledger Requests

In this chapter we will describe sending requests to the smart contract as transactions on the Tangle.
It is so called `on-ledger` requests and can be sent to any chain deployed on the Tangle without accessing Wasp node,
just posting transaction to the Tangle. The ISCP committe is actively monitoring the Tangle and will be aware of the request.
