# How To Withdraw From a Chain

The `withdraw` endpoint sends funds owned by the callee to their L1 address.

<Tabs
    defaultValue="solo"
    values={[
        {label: 'Solo', value: 'solo'},
        {label: 'Rust (ISCP)', value: 'rust'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="solo">

```go
_, err := chain.PostRequestSync(
	solo.NewCallParams(accounts.Contract.Name, accounts.FuncDeposit.Name).WithIotas(N),
	wallet,
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rust">

```rust
// withdrawals from a chain (funds go to the common account, as there is no way to specify hname for withdrawals)
let transfer = ScTransfers::iotas(1);
ctx.post(chainID, ScHname::new("accounts"), ScHname::new("withdraw"), None, transfer, 0);
```
